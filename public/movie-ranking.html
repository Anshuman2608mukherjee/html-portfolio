<h1>The Best Animes According to Anshuman</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Animes of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. I love the fighting animation.One piece hooked me on right from the first<br /> 
    episode and I found myself watching 25-30 episodeson my first day and caught up in a month-a month<br /> 
    and a 1/2. There was always points where I didn't thinkit would be able to surpass but the series always<br />
    proves me wrong.It has one of the best power systems something a lot of anime struggle with, good fights,<br />
    unique quirky art and character that made me stay away from the show but the moreI watch it the more<br /> 
    I fall in love with it.<br />

<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>
    It has an interesting story and a good plot line.<br />
     The action is exciting, the comedy is great, the characters are likable (except Sakura perhaps),<br />
     the plot develops quite well and everything is very well performed. But then again,<br />
     there's also something a lot of anime succumb to. The wonderful world of fillers..<br/>
</p>
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>This is a masterpiece built in tragedy and the love of family. A brother comes home only to find<br />
    his family slain by a demon. The sister survives and is t√πrned to a demon as well. It is a journey<br />
    of the brother to find a cure and defend his sister.<br />
